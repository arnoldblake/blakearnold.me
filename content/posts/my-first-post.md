After all of the wordpress drama I decided to take a look for an alternative. Hugo appeared to be a popular solution.
I am enjoying the local development evnironment I can run. I also do not have high demands for a website and would like
to start using this site as a place to put my thoughts and interests. Having this be a public place give me some sense
of responsibility and expectations associated with what I put here.
