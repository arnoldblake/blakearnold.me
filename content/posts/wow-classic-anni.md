A fresh batch of servers is scheduled to be released for WoW Classic on November 21st 2024. I've been playing WoW since its release in 2004 though the Cataclysm expansion where things started to die off for me. I've touched each expansion here and there since then but havent spent much time with them. I feel like the game lost itself somewhere along the way. But I am excited to restart my journey for the 4th time (vanilla, classic, SOD). To help add a bit of a twist to this reset I am tinkering with the option of running a 5-party multibox setup. I've played a couple of hours on the era servers with a paladin, priest, and mage and it seems doable. Blizzard has banned the use of input broadcasting software which made the enitre process much easier. But I have a working concept utilizing a couple tools such as ShiftWindow to automatically position my wow clients. And other addons he first being EMA which provides a lot of in-game utility for managing quests, party, etc.
