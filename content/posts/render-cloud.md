Since my last failed migration to S3, the idea was still bouncing around in my head to migrate to a solution
for static site hosting. The Changelog had a great podcast recently highlighting [Render.com](https://render.com). I did run into one
issue in the build process but support quickly pointed me in the direction of a community post that had a working
solution. Overall I am impressed with the experience and will enjoy exploring more of their features.
