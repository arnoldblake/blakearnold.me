I've had the ~discomfort~ pleasure of going though a few changes over the past 6 months or so. And no were not talking
about seasonal changes, or changing the time, these are professional changes. One common thread I picked up on was the
assurance that the status quo would be maintained. However there was a stark contrast in the delivery of the message on
both occurances. My thoughts on how to deliver the news of change would be to have a clear plan in place. Its impossible
to prepare for every scenario but having a clear message and thought on the future goes a long way and shows that
matters are being taken seriously. Delivering conflicting information causes doubt and confusion for parties involved.
Remote work has certainly thrown a wrench in the process. People are no longer just a walk down the hallway. Remote
workers are no longer privilege to watercooler conversations. Not necessarily gossip but having your ear to the ground
so to speak. Theres the official message being delivered but a significant aspect to that message is the leading up to
it. Change doesnt happen in a vaccum, there is a series of events that takes place before hand. Topics are discussed,
feelings are heard, meetings planned, work gets done, etc. I'm not quite sure what point I am trying to make, if there is
one, but I felt it was a small message worth sharing.
