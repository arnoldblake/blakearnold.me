I was starting to get a warning from TrueNAS about low disk space on my NAS. I recently upgraded to TrueNAS Scale about
a month ago from FreeNAS. I have really enjoyed using TrueNAS. I used to roll my own services directly on top of Ubuntu
but the overhead of maintaing everything has gotten to me. TrueNAS Core has been simple and easy to work with and a nice
upgrade from FreeNAS. I had been running a single vdev mirror of two disks with one spare. Once my drive and an extra
sata power cable arrived reassigning the spare and the new drive into a 2x2 mirror took only a matter of minutes. Next
step ill have to take on is planning the migration out to larger drives since I've hit the max number of drives I can
squeeze in my spare PC case.
